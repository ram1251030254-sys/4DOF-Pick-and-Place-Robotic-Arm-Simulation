# 4DOF-Pick-and-Place-Robotic-Arm-Simulation
# Conveyor-Based Robotic Pick & Place with Box Stacking

An industrial-style robotic arm simulation that automatically picks moving boxes from a conveyor belt and stacks them neatly.

This project demonstrates real-world automation concepts using **robot kinematics, motion planning, and animation**.

---

## Project Overview

This system simulates a robotic arm that:

✔ Picks boxes from a moving conveyor  
✔ Attaches the box to the gripper realistically  
✔ Moves to stacking location  
✔ Places boxes in a stacked arrangement  
✔ Repeats the process automatically  
✔ Displays pick count in real time  

The animation mimics real industrial automation workflows.

## How It Works

### Conveyor Movement
Boxes move continuously toward the pick point.

### Pick Detection
Robot waits until box reaches the pickup zone.

### Gripping Process
Box smoothly attaches to the gripper without lag.

### Transport Motion
Robot carries the box to stacking position.

### Stacking Logic
Boxes are stacked vertically with proper spacing.

### Loop Execution
Process repeats automatically for 10 cycles.
